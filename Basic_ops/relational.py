""" This code will introduce you basic relational operations in python 
    we will learn relational operations on diffrent variables """

"""Basic relational operators are =(Equalto),!=(Not Equalto), <(less than), 
    <=(Less than or Equal to), >(greater than) and >=(Greater than equal to)
    these operators will help us to get the relation between two variables 
    basically results a boolean output"""

#Arthemetic operations on numerical variables     
a=10 
b=20 

#relational operator of Equal to is "=="
print("a=b is:",a==b)
#relational operator of Not Equal to is "!="
print("a Not Equal to b is:",a!=b)
#relational operator of less than to is "<"
print("a less than b is:",a<b)
#relational operator of less than or equla to  is "<="
print("a less than or equal to b is:",a<=b)
#relational operator of greater than to is ">"
print("a greater than b is:",a>b)
#relational operator of less than or equla to  is ">="

#You can try redefining the variables before each print statement to check the results
