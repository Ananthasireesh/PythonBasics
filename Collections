#Python collections

##############################Lists######################
#A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable.
##############declaration of lists######################
#In Python lists are written with square brackets or we can use the list() command.

MyClass=["punith","Abhirami","vatsala","Priyanka"]
NewList=list(("Smita","Yogesh"))

#The above list consists of a list with 6 strings, and in python the list starts from index 0

print(MyClass[0]) # Gives First Element of the list
print(MyClass[2]) # Gives the third element of the list 
print(NewList[1]) # Gives me last element of list since we have only two elements 
#Lists can also be accsessed from back side as well
#indexing from back starts from -1
print(MyClass[-1]) #Gives the last element of the list
print(MyClass[-3]) #Gives 3rd element from back side

###########Slicing in Lists################
#list slicing will have inclusive of left side element and exclusive of right side element
print(MyClass[:2]) #Returns from 1st element to 3rd element
print(MyClass[1:]) #Returns list from 2nd element to last element
print(MyClass[1:3])#Returns list from 2nd element to last before element
print(MyClass[0:-1])#returns whole list except last element
#Functions for lists 
print(len(MyClass)) #gives length of list
#Append Function will append the element mentioned to end of the list
MyClass.append(NewList)
print(MyClass)
#By mistake we have inserted previous list two times, can we remove it now?
MyClass.remove(MyClass[4])
print(MyClass)
#del function can remove directly from index 
del(MyClass[6]) #will delete 7th element
print(MyClass)
MyClass.count("Abhirami") #Returns how many times the mentioned name is repeted
#insert is used to insert a specific value @ specific index
MyClass.insert(5,"Antik") #inserts above value as 6th element
print(MyClass)
